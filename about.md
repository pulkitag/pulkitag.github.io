Rumblings about a path to General Artificial Intelligence. Find a record of interesting papers, commentary on key ideas in the field.

In my opinion, intelligence is not special. It is an emergent phenomenon when an agent lives in a rich environment and acts according to a few computational principles. I would really encourage you to have a look at [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and an excellent read from [Braitenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg) called [Vehicles](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vehicles). These works show that very simple principles in rich enough environments produce complex behavior. While such simple principles might not suffice or might not even be on the right track to create intelligence as we know of, they provide evidence that it might be possible to obtain complex intelligent behavior if we get the right computational principles. One such key principle is curiosity. I will expand on this with time. Let's just get started for now!
