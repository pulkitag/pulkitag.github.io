In the era of block worlds, the strategy to control was to first observe and then
move. This was in general was called ``visual feedback``. The term ``visual servoing``
appears to have been introduced by Hill & Park [Real time control of a robot with a
mobile camera] in 1979, to distinguish from the earlier approach of first taking
picture and then acting.
